# ðŸš€ Interspace Dodge Game

Interspace Dodge Game is a fast-paced, space-themed dodge game built with vanilla JavaScript, Phaser framework, HTML, and CSS. Created as a personal learning project in 2020, this game was a fun and immersive way to dive deeper into JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and basic game development logic.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

In Interspace Dodge, you control a spaceship flying through endless space while avoiding incoming asteroids. The longer you survive, the faster and more unpredictable the asteroids become. The game map is fixed and always the same but when you beat it , you can improve your moves, because every move count.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

This project was completed as a solo learning endeavor over a couple of weeks in 2020. While not actively maintained, it stands as a fun and functional arcade-style mini-game that helped me learn a lot about browser-based game mechanics and JavaScript.
